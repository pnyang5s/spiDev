			<h1><i>About the Author</i></h1>
			<p>	
			<u>Silver Phlora Young</u>
			</p>
			<p>
			Born in April of 1990, in teh midlands of Thailand. Though she was born in this country, she is not noted as a citizen of Thailand because she was born within a small Refugee camp 
			created after the end of the Vietnam War. When her parents decided to leave Thailand for a better life in the United Sates, she finally had a country of her own in the early 2000s when she finally signed her citizenship papers in Boston, Massachusetts. As a child raised in two worlds, one with the mind of the old country and one with the 
				mind of the new, she had struggled to be who she wanted to be, however, the one convergant between these two worlds is that she wanted to be a writer, to tell her story, to tell the stories. Each book she writes is a creative view of her life, the people she's met, the situation she was in, and where she wants to be. When you read a section in a book and wonder why 
				the author writes it like this, it is because this is part of  her story. <p> Stay tuned to what SPY has in store for her future books to come. </p>
